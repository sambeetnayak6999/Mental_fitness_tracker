# Mental Fitness Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict mental fitness levels using machine learning techniques. I have collected two datasets, merged and cleaned them to create a comprehensive dataset. The goal is to develop a predictive model that can estimate mental fitness based on various input features.

## Project Overview

- Data Collection & Preparation: 
  - Two datasets related to mental fitness were gathered from reliable sources.
  - These datasets were merged to form a single, more extensive dataset.
  - Data cleaning steps were applied, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing features to ensure data quality.

- Modeling
  - A Random Forest Regressor was employed to build the predictive model.
  - Hyperparameter tuning was performed to optimize the model's performance.

- Evaluation Metrics:
  - The model's performance was evaluated using the following metrics:
    - Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average of the squares of the errors.
    - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Provides the square root of the average squared differences between predicted and actual values.
    - R² Score: Indicates the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.

- Visualization:
  - Various graphs and plots were generated to visualize the data distribution, feature importance, and model performance.

 Results & Insights

- The Random Forest model provided robust predictions with .
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.0006253050326068914
  -Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0.025006099907960287
  -R² Score: 0.99498230888529

 Conclusion

This project showcases the application of machine learning in the mental health domain. By merging and cleaning datasets and applying advanced regression techniques, valuable insights into mental fitness can be gained.
